Entering in this competitive industry I need to choose the best location to open my restaurant in order to increase the possibility of success. \n\n#### To reducing the marketing cost and gaining external economies of scale, I would like to open my restaurant in the Chinese community and next to other Chinese restaurants. Since other Chinese restaurants had already obtained a certain number of customers, so if their customers notice there is a new restaurant opened maybe they would like to give it a try. In this project, I would like to find out where is the good spot for me to open the restaurant based on the Yelp data I got. "
